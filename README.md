## General Information
- This allowed me to consolidate core concepts and refresh working with hooks ( more time spent on class components ) before looking into state management ( Redux ).
- This was also my fist real experience with Scss, I have a lot of appreciation for CSS as it seems like this never ending language where there is always something knew to learn.
- Scss is a great addition as itâ€™s very intuitive with nesting, variables and partials, I will definitely be using it in the future.


## Technologies Used
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - version 17.0.2
- [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/)


## Lessons Learned
- Passing, deconstructing and drilling props
- Modifying, passing and lifting state
- Working with hooks such as useRef for capturing input values and useState
