# React music player ( chillhop )
[[Live Version]](https://chillhop-phi.vercel.app/)

React music player with play / pause, skip forward / back and a drag handler to change the position of the song with a library of songs from chillhop.com

This allowed me to consolidate core concepts and refresh working with hooks before looking into state management ( Redux ).

This was also my fist real experience with Scss, I have a lot of appreciation for CSS as it seems like this never ending language where there is always something knew to learn.

Scss is a great addition as itâ€™s very intuitive nesting and using partials, I will definitely be using it in the future.
